Personal branding infrastructure: showcase & operations.

## The Architecture

Unlike a standard portfolio, this infrastructure is built on three operational pillars:
* **Authority Front-end** – A minimalist, high-conversion interface designed for elite positioning.
* **Newsletter Engine** – Proprietary authoring and distribution system, engineered for maximum deliverability.
* **Operational Dashboard** – Private administration layer for real-time monitoring of messages, subscribers, and performance analytics.

## Engineering Standards

+ **Operational Integrity** – Integrated webhook handling and automated email flows designed for high deliverability.
+ **Architecture Patterns** – Strict separation of concerns between business logic, UI, and API routes.
+ **Performance First** – Built with Next.js 16, Tailwind, and TypeScript for a production-ready environment.
